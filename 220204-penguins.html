      <p>
        In humans, what makes a man visibly different from the opposite sex also
        makes him more appealing. Features like the broad shoulders, square
        jaws, and towering height form the picture of (stereotypical) manliness.
        I wanted to see if there are equivalents for penguins ‚Äî telltale signs
        of masculinity in these round, cushy waddling birds.

        (I also just wanted an excuse to start this blog. The Palmer penguin
        data<sup>(<a href="#note-1">1</a>)</sup> is one of those ABC intro
        materials you're very likely to come across, if you're trying to learn
        anything data related. I thought this would be an interesting way to
        rediscover such a familiar dataset.)

        Weight shows the largest gender gap for all three species. This makes
        sense: a study of one Ad√©lie colony found that 17.3% of chick losses
        were from parent deserting the nest due to starvation, and since the
        returning mates arrived only a few days later, the loss could have been
        avoided if the parent could hold out for a little longer. In the waiting
        game, it's advantageous to be a large, fat penguin.<sup

        On a few features, we can almost draw a line to separate male from
        female observations. On others, blue and green dots intermigle, with
        both genders occupying roughly the same range of measurements. This also
        makes sense: in humans, broad shoulders or sharp face shapes are not
        exclusive to men. Not one but several features together are better
        predictor of sex.
      </p>

        Side note: just from these graphs alone, it looks to me like plump,
        curvaceous women with significant lips would translate to very macho
        penguins, making them highly desirable to both species.

            in these graphs don't reflect conclusions from the research paper
            that comes with the dataset. The paper suggests the strongest
            predictors of male are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weight and beak length in Ad√©lie</li>
            <li>Weight and beak depth in Gentoo</li>
            <li>Beak length and depth in Chinstrap</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            ...with weight the least predictive feature for Chinstrap, and wing
            length a weak predictor for all three species. Comparing averages
            may be a weak way to determine predictive features, as it
            doesn't take into account the many overlaps in the observation
            ranges of two genders. A large overlap means we cannot draw a line
            to separate one gender's observations from the other's. Features
            with large overlaps, therefore, cannot be used to easily distinguish
            categories. For this classification problem, multivariate logistic
            regression and more advanced statistical analyses, like those
            performed in the research paper, would be a better way to go. Since
            I'm statistic-illiterate, here's a penguin: üêß
