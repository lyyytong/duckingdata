      <p>
        In humans, what makes a man noticeably different from the opposite sex
        seems to make him more appealing. Physical features like the broad
        shoulders, square jaws, and superior height appear often as qualifiers
        of (stereotypical) manliness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to see if there are equivalents for penguins ‚Äî visible features
        whose size signals strong masculinity. The below visualization was made
        from a dataset<sup>(<a href="#note-1">1</a>)</sup> of body measurements
        from 333<sup>(<a href="#note-2">2</a>)</sup>
        brush-tailed (also called rump-legged, or Pygoscelis) penguins,
        including the Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo species.

        Weight shows the widest gender gap for all three species. This makes
        sense: a study of one Ad√©lie colony found that 17.3% of chick losses
        were from parent deserting the nest due to starvation, and since the
        returning mates arrived only a few days later, the loss could have been
        avoided if the parent could hold out for a little longer. In the waiting
        game, it's advantageous to be a large, fat penguin.<sup
          >(<a href="#note-3">3</a>)</sup
        >
        <mark
          >For mommy penguins, fatter husbands mean higher chance of survival
          for her babies.</mark
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        While males are generally larger than females, the distinction can be
        subtle. On few features ‚Äî weight for Ad√©lie and Gentoo, beak depth for
        Gentoo, and to lesser extent beak length for Chinstrap ‚Äî we can almost
        draw a line to roughly separate observations of each gender. On others,
        blue and green dots migle over large areas, with both genders occupying
        the same range of measurements.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also makes sense: in humans, broad shoulders or angular face shapes
        are not exclusive to men. Not one but a combination of several features
        may be more accurate predictor of sex.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may be an overgeneralization, but it looks like plump, curvaceous women with
        significant lips would translate to very macho penguins, making them highly
        desirable to both species.

            averages in this graph don't reflect conclusions from the research
            paper that accompanies the dataset. It suggests the strongest
            predictive features of male are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Weight and beak length for Ad√©lie</li>
            <li>Weight and beak depth for Gentoo</li>
            <li>Beak length and depth for Chinstrap</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With weight the least predictive feature for Chinstrap, and wing
            length a weak predictor for all three species. Beside showing the
            latter (wing length), the graph fails to reflect most of the rest.
            This may be because comparing averages is a weak way to determine
            predictive features: it doesn't take into account the many overlaps
            in the observation ranges of two genders. A large overlap means the
            feature cannot be used to easily distinguish categories. For this
            classification problem, multivariate logistic regression and more
            advanced statistical analyses, like those performed in the research
            paper, would be a better way to go. Since I'm statistic-illiterate,
            here's a penguin: üêß
