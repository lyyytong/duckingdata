      <p>
        Mathematicians and lay people mean different things when it comes to
        "prime". In maths, primes are numbers greater than 1 that cannot be
        divided by any number other than 1 and themselves. 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
        are primes. They're "the atoms of number theory, the basic indivisble
        entities of which all numbers are made"<sup>
          (<a href="#note-1">1</a>)</sup
        >, and so occupy a very special place in the world of number theory.
      </p>
      <div>
        <p>
          On the other hand, in an Asian country with strong Chinese influence
          (like Vietnam, where I'm from), prime usually means lucky numbers. A
          number is lucky if it's made up of lucky digits, which are those when
          pronounced in Mandarin or Cantonese sound like a good word:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>9 sounds like "longevity" üññ</li>
          <li>8 "prosperity" üí∏</li>
          <li>6 "happiness", "fortune" üçÄ</li>
          <li>2 "easy", "bright" üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</li>
          <li>0 "good" üë∂</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          4 sounds like "death" ‚Äî the most unlucky number. 1, 3, 5, 7 could
          sound like many things, and so their meaning depends on context, or
          the pairing with other digits.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        In Vietnam, a numbered asset that contains many 9s and 8s sees its price
        increased significantly, sometimes jacked up to astronomical range: in
        2018, the phone number 0989999999 was bought for 19 billion VND (around
        819,000 USD at the time)<sup>(<a href="#note-2">2</a>)</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's assume now that good numbers really do breed good deeds<sup
          >(<a href="#note-3">3</a>)</sup
        >. What if you're a business person in Vietnam who, in the race for rare
        success, aspires for mathematical elegance?
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is primes greater than 2 are all odd numbers (by
        definition they cannot be divisible by 2), which means that by choosing
        a lucky number that's also a prime, you've cut down the competing
        possibilities by at least half. This makes your number at least twice as
        rare.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even better: primes other than 5 cannot be divisible by 5, further
        removing from competition all longer numbers ending with 5. Even better
        than better: primes appear a bit less often as we move into bigger
        numbers. Below is a histogram that shows
        <mark>the decreasing occurence of primes</mark
        ><sup>(<a href="#note-4">4</a>)</sup>
        smaller than one billion.

        So the bigger the prime, the rarer it is, and rare is good (I doubt
        anyone would pay as much for something everyone else can have). Now, we
        also want our pick at the lucky digits ‚Äî the more 8s and 9s the better.
        Luckily, by counting
        <mark
          >the occurrence of each digit in the more than 50 million primes</mark
        >
        under one billion, we can see that lucky digits are in good supply.
        Especially if you're flexible with their position in your long number.

        However, the sense that a number belongs to you doesn't just come from
        its digits, it's also the pattern they form, how rare it is, and what
        special meanings it has. Of more than 50 million primes, there's
        actually
        <mark>a good amount that contain very premium looking patterns</mark>,
        like 888, 999, and 123123. (Or 6969. There's something for everyone.)

        To sum it up, it seems to me that when we apply both definitions of
        "prime" ‚Äî the mathematical and Chinese numerological, we end up with
        pretty interesting numbers. The properties of primes boost their rarity,
        without restricting our choice in lucky digits and patterns. After all,
        if our Vietnamese business(wo)man is going to pay big bucks for it, why
        not add an extra layer of meaning to further justify the cost? I've
        never heard of a lucky charm, collector's item, or artwork having too
        much meaning.

        Let's now explore our lucky primes. To avoid the browser choking on
        itself, I've applied a set of arbitrary rules<sup

        to reduce the 50 million primes down to just 3.3 million ‚Äî some of the
