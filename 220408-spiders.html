        The World Spider Catalog<sup>(<a href="#note-1">1</a>)</sup> chronicles
        all spider species discovered between 1757 and present day — up to 2019
        in this particular dataset. It lists a total of 47,714 recognized species, which
        such rich information on year and location of discovery that I think I
        got hiccups from excitement.
      </p>
      <p>
        For ease of visualization, I've reduced location details to more broad
        continent groups<sup>(<a href="#note-2">2</a>)</sup>. Species data of
        six continents together with a world summary<sup
          >(<a href="#note-3">3</a>)</sup
        >
        is shown in the below radial graph. Yearly
        <mark>new discoveries</mark> are on the outer ring, and
        <mark>accumulated discoveries</mark> (i.e. total species known as of any
        given year) on the inner circle.

        Asia and Africa have the most spiders in the long run. Europe ranks
        last, with its number of species only one third that of Asia. However,
        during the 18th and 19th centuries Europe rivaled Asia in the number of
        most yearly discoveries, probably due to rich naturalist activities and
        (then) more advanced record-keeping.

          Moving from continent view to spider close-ups, I wanted a way to
          highlight interesting spiders in the context of quantitative data.
          There were several levels of spider grouping<sup
            >(<a href="#note-4">4</a>)</sup
          >
          to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Several spider <mark>species</mark> can belong to a
            <mark>genus</mark>; e.g. the infamous black widow and its less
            venomous brown relative belong to the genus Latrodectus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Several genera belong to a <mark>family</mark>; e.g. Latrodectus and
            Parasteatoda (genus of the common house spiders) both belong to the
            family Theridiidae.
          </li>
          <li>
            Several families belong to an <mark>infraorder</mark>; e.g.
            Theridiidae and Desidae (family to which belong marine spiders that
            live inbetween ocean tides) belong to the infraorder Araneomorphae.
          </li>
          <li>
            Several infraorders belong to a <mark>suborder</mark>; and all
            suborders, in turn, belong to the umbrella
            <mark>order</mark> Araneae — air-breathing arthropods that have
            eight legs, fangs generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets
            that extrude silk — known as spiders.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          (The order Araneae itself belongs to the class Arachnid, which
          includes spiders, scorpions, ticks, mites, vinegaroons, and others.)
        </p>

        Since each species was one data point, and very few species are popular
        enough to have a catchy name like "black widow" — their scientific name
        often long and not that easy on the eye, I decided to focus on the genus
        level. Below is a graph of <mark>top spider genera</mark>, detailing
        their discovery over time and their brief profile.

            Since this was primarily a visualization exercise, I took a lot of
            liberties in manually attributing continents to locations. For
            example, St. Helena island, almost half way between South America
            and Africa, was grouped into Africa. Species with Mediterranean tags
            were grouped into Europe, even though they very well could be found
            in some North African port cities. Some remote locations, like the
            South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, although closer to South
            America, were put together with the French Southern and Antarctic
            Lands into the continent of Antartica, which, in the end, was not
            shown in the graphs as it has too few species. I think manually
            editing more than 47 thousand data points, plus a weak knowledge in
            geography, led to some comatose decisions I'd really like not to
            repeat in the next project.

            Many species were reportedly discovered on multiple continents
            within the same year. The total amount of world's species can
            therefore be less than the sum of the continents' in any given year.
