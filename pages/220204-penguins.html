      <header class="pop">What makes a manly penguin?</header>
      <p>
        In humans, what makes a man noticeably different from the opposite sex
        tends to make him more appealing. Physical features like the broad
        shoulders, square jaws, and superior height appear often as qualifiers
        of (stereotypical) manliness.

        I wanted to see if there are equivalents for penguins ‚Äî visible features
        whose size signals strong
        <span class="pop">male-ness</span>. The below visualization was made
        from a dataset<sup>1</sup> of body measurements from 333<sup>2</sup>
        brush-tailed (also called rump-legged, or Pygoscelis) penguins,
        including the Ad√©lie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo species.

        Weight shows the widest gender gap for all three species. This makes
        sense, as a study of one Ad√©lie colony found that 17.3% of chick losses
        were from parent deserting the nest due to starvation. The loss could
        have been avoided if the parent could hold out for a little longer,
        since the returning mates arrived only a few days later. In the waiting
        game, it's advantageous to be a large, fat penguin.<sup>3</sup> For
        mommy penguins,

        Second, while males are generally larger than females, the distinction
        can be subtle. Some features show more pronounced difference, where we
        can almost draw a line to separate observations of each gender, like
        weight for Ad√©lie and Gentoo, beak depth for Gentoo, and to lesser
        extent beak length for Chinstrap. There are otherwise large areas where
        blue and green dots migle, where both genders occupy the same range.
        This also makes sense: in humans, for example, broad shoulders or
        angular face shapes are not exlusive to men.
        <span class="pop">A combination of several features together</span>,
        rather than just one, may be more accurate predictor of sex.

        <p>
          <span class="pop">Limitions: </span>The highlighted averages in this
          graph don't reflect conclusions from the research paper<sup>1</sup>
          that accompanies the dataset. It suggests the strongest predictive
          features of male are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Weight and beak length for Ad√©lie</li>
          <li>Weight and beak depth for Gentoo</li>
          <li>Beak length and depth for Chinstrap</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With weight the least predictive feature for Chinstrap, and wing
          length a weak predictor for all three species.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Beside showing that wing length has the smallest gender gap in all three
        species, the graph fails to reflect most of the rest. This may be
        because comparing averages is a weak way to determine which features are
        predictive of sex, as it doesn't take into account overlaps in the
        observation ranges of two genders, of which there are many, as mentioned
        earlier. A large overlap means the feature cannot be used to easily
        distinguish categories.

        For this classification problem, multivariate logistic regression and
        more advanced statistical analyses, like ones performed in the research
        paper, would be a better way to go. Since I'm statistic-illiterate,
        here's a penguin: üêß
